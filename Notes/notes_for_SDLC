5) IN-DEPTH SOFTWARE TESTING
	Purpose: Ensure the product has no bugs or exploits and that it is in line with DDS expectations
	Key personnel: All levels of testers
	Output: A thoroughly tested version of the product
6) SOFTWARE DEPLOYMENT
	Purpose: Push the new product into production by gradually phasing it into use
